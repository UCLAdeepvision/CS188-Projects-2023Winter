> Deepfakes are videos of a human subject where the person's facial features are altered or swapped with another person's face in order to "change" a person's identity. One common application is videos where a person's face is exchanged for another such that it seems as though another person is speaking. This technology is highly deceptive and may pose as a severe security, so researchers are working on deepfake detection: a method to determine whether a given sample is or is not a deepfake.

## Proposal
### Project Description
The aim of this project is to define a benchmark for deepfake detection dataset quality in various use cases. We will be ranking known datasets by their overall effectiveness as well as their effectiveness in specified categories such as criminal justice, politics, social media, and more. In order to do so, we will use various existing models such as MesoNet to evaluate these datasets.

The purpose of this project is to inform future creation of deepfake detection datasets of how best to create their datasets by providing analyses on the most important parameters, variables, factors, involved in making the data as useful as possible in all scenarios. Whether it's racial diversity, age groups, or other contributing factors, having guidance in constructing a dataset would prove useful in quickening the improvement of deepfake detection models.
