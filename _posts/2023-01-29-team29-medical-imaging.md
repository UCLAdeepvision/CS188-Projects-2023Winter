## Project Proposal

Project Proposal: Image Segmentation of Breast Cancer Images Using U-Net and Contrastive Loss

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and early treatment of breast cancer is crucial for improving patient prognosis. Image segmentation is an important step in medical image analysis, as it helps to isolate and highlight regions of interest in an image. This project aims to perform image segmentation on breast cancer images using a deep learning model known as U-Net, along with a contrastive loss function.U-Net is a popular deep learning model used for image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, and is trained to generate a segmented image from a corresponding input image. In this project, the U-Net architecture will be used to perform image segmentation on breast cancer images.The contrastive loss function is a recent development in deep learning and is used to train models with improved accuracy and stability. In this project, a contrastive loss function will be used along with the U-Net model to optimize the image segmentation results.
