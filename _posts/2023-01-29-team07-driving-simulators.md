## Our Project
Our project is concerned with driving simulators, and the learning of self driving vehicles within these simulators.



### Relevant Context

Metadrive is a driving simulator that generates infinite scenes and roadmaps to support the learning of the self driving vehicles.

- [Metadrive Code Repo](https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive)

CARLA is another driving simulator designed for autonomous driving research. In the attached paper, the developers of CARLA also train a few models to analyze their performance.

DI-Drive is a "single platform" that allows one to train models for Autonomous Driving, built the above two driving simulators.
