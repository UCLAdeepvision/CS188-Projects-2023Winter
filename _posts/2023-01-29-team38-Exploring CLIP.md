# Week 3: Project Proposal
## Description
The goal of this project is to explore and understand CLIP - Cross-Lingual Image-Text Pre-training. Previous Methods for computer vision typically requires large amount of data and are trained only to perform well in one specific task. CLIP is able to solve these problems by jointly training image encoder and text encoder. It is able to train a model that can move to a task that it has not seen before without large amount of extra data.  For our project, we want to run the code for CLIP on our own and explore its properties.

## Main Content
Your survey starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucladeepvision.github.io/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLAdeepvision/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under /assets/images/, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

### More Markdown Syntax
You can find more Markdown syntax at [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Reference
Please make sure to cite properly in your work, for example:
