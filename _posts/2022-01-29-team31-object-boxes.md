> In this project, we wish to dive deep and examine the YOLO v7 (You Only Look Once) object detection model while exploring any possible improvements. YOLO v7 is one of the fastest object detection models in the world today which provides highly accurate real-time object detection. During our examination, we will inspect the layers and algorithms within YOLO v7, test the pre-trained YOLO v7 model provided by the YOLO team, and train and test YOLO v7 against different datasets.

## 1. Introduction
The main idea behind the YOLO class of object detection algorithms is summarized in its acronym: "you only look once." This means that YOLO models are single-stage, allowing them to immediately and accurately classify images. In fact, the speed is one of the major selling-points of this algorithm, allowing it to be marketed as a real-time object detector. It does this by immediately featurizing images before feeding the features into the model.

YOLO v7 is the latest in a line of YOLO object detection projects, beginning in 2015. Through each iteration, the YOLO models have become faster and more accurate by changing their base CNN structures, loss functions, and box-generation approaches. One of YOLO v7s biggest changes over YOLO v6 is its use of anchor boxes, a set of pre-generated boxes with varying aspect ratios used to detect objects. YOLO v7 has also improved over previous accuracies by using a focal loss function instead of the standard cross-entropy. This loss function is better at recognizing small objects, since it focuses more heavily on difficult-to-classify objects rather than treating all equally.

The YOLO v7 model itself consists of three main parts, whith anatomical names to describe their functions: a backbone, neck, and head. The backbone is the first stage reached by the input. In it, the image is broken up into essential features. This feature data is then passed to the neck, in which feature pyramids are assembled, an extremely quick and high-quality, though expensive, method of feature extraction. The actual prediction part occurs in the head, which outputs detection boxes and prediction labels.

## 2. Setting Up YOLO v7

### 2.1 Loading Pre-Trained Model
Code based off: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/AlexeyAB/b769f5795e65fdab80086f6cb7940dae/yolov7detection.ipynb)
<br>
Within the Official YOLOv7 repository, there are a few pre-trained YOLOv7 models that have been trained solely through the MS COCO Dataset. Some of these models are designed to work better on edge devices, such as YOLOv7-tiny, while others are designed to work better on stronger cloud devices, such as YOLOv7-W6. For the purposes of this demo, I will use the standard YOLOv7 pre-trained model.

1. Basic Setup: import sys, torch and clone the YOLOv7 repository.
```
import sys
import torch
!git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7
```

2. Download the pre-trained model:
```
!wget https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt
```

3. Run object detection:
```
!python detect.py --weights yolov7.pt --conf 0.25 --img-size 640 --source inference/images/yolo-test1.jpg
```

4. Define helper function to view images and load image:

```
def imShow(path):
  import cv2
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  %matplotlib inline

  image = cv2.imread(path)
  height, width = image.shape[:2]
  resized_image = cv2.resize(image,(3*width, 3*height), interpolation = cv2.INTER_CUBIC)

  fig = plt.gcf()
  fig.set_size_inches(18, 10)
  plt.axis("off")
  plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(resized_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
  plt.show()

imShow("runs/detect/exp5/yolo-test1.jpg")

```

### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |

### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.
