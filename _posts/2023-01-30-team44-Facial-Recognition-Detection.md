## Jan. 29 Submission

### Topic: Facial Recognition and Detection
Daniel Kim will explore the world of facial detection, and if possible, recognition as well. In the modern world, security and filters through cameras is a huge portion of deep learning, and I wish to explore these topics for my project.

### Relevant Papers

1. [Face Detection with the Faster R-CNN (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7961803)
    * This paper discusses using a faster R-CNN framework and learning to try and speed up and more accurately determine detection.."

2. [A Deep Learning Approach for Face Detection using YOLO (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8745376)
    * This paper is one that discusses the usage of YOLO for object detection and how it can be translated also for face detection, and the approach involving deep learning to make this a reality.

3. [Efficient face detection and tracking in video sequences based on deep learning (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002002552100270X)
    *  The paper proposes a SENResNet face detection model to detect facial information in each video frame and extract the position information of the target face. In order to make facial detection a reality, the usage needs to be translated not only to just photos, but also videos as effectively done in this paper's experiments.

<!-- ## Main Content

Your survey starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucladeepvision.github.io/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLAdeepvision/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md)

## Basic Syntax

### Image

Please create a folder with the name of your team id under /assets/images/, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.

### Table

Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |

### Code Block

```python
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```

### Formula

Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

You can find more Markdown syntax at [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Reference

Please make sure to cite properly in your work, for example:

[1] Redmon, Joseph, et al. "You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection." *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*. 2016.
