> Object detection is an invaluable computer vision task that requires locating objects in an image and classifying or identifying them. This project explains some deep learning algorithms used for object detection and reproduces their results using OpenMMLab's MMDetection toolbox.

## Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to understand and explain some important object detection algorithms in a clear way, as well as reproduce results of these algorithms by using the MMDetection toolbox. We would like to run object detection on some images we have taken ourselves. We also aim to provide a comparison of various object detection algorithms.
