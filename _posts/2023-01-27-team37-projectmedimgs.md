## Proposal
Medical Imaging


Medical Image Segmentation refers to  the process of taking 2D or 3D image data and dividing  it into regions of interest. An example might be to take a Computed Tomography (CT) scan and isolate a particular anomaly within a patient. Doing medical image segmentation by hand can be a cumbersome task. Thus, the goal of this project is to automate this task with deep learning, with accuracy close to human standards.

## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under /assets/images/, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.

You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].

Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work.


### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.

|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          |



### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
```


### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$

or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.

### More Markdown Syntax
You can find more Markdown syntax at [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Reference
Please make sure to cite properly in your work, for example:

[1] Redmon, Joseph, et al. "You only look once: Unified, real-time object detection." *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*. 2016.
