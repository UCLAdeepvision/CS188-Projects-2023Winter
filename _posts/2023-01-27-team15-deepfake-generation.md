## Three Most Relevant Research Papers

**“Deep Fakes” using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)** 
http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228_2018/Reports/Report16.pdf [1]

This article discusses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which are deep learning models which utilize two sub-models to learn patterns in data. This paper discusses a cycle-GAN network with the goals of helping with object transfiguration and style transfer.

**StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation** 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020 [2]

This publication discusses StarGAN, a novel method of performing image to image translations using only one model.
Code: https://github.com/yunjey/StarGAN


**Deep Image Spatial Transformation for Person Image Generation** 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00696 [3]

This paper proposes a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework that can be used on feature inputs. This is useful for spatial transformation and person image generation.
