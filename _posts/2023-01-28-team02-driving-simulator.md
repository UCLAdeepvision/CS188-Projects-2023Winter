## Introduction
Driving simulators provide the fundamental platform for autonomous driving researches. By integrating various deep learning or reinforcement learning pipelines and engines, driving simulators facilitate and standardize model training, validation, testing, and evaluation. The iterations in driving simulators have aimed at a better integration of powerful DL/RL platforms and realistic scene simulations.

## Possible project topics
1. Integration of an existing algorithm/model with another driving simulator.
2. Evaluation of the effect of sensory inputs removal/addition on an implemented model.
3. Evaluate a trained & tested model under new scenes with certain events.

<!-- Your survey starts here. You can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/lilianweng/lil-log/tree/master/_posts) of [lil's blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) for article structure ideas or Markdown syntax. We've provided a [sample post](https://ucladeepvision.github.io/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/2017/06/21/an-overview-of-deep-learning.html) from Lilian Weng and you can find the source code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLAdeepvision/CS188-Projects-2022Winter/main/_posts/2017-06-21-an-overview-of-deep-learning.md) -->

<!-- ## Basic Syntax
### Image
Please create a folder with the name of your team id under /assets/images/, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.
You can add an image to your survey like this:
![YOLO]({{ '/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/object_detection.png' | relative_url }})
{: style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"}
*Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision* [1].
Please cite the image if it is taken from other people's work. -->

<!-- 
### Table
Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.
|             | column 1    |  column 2     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| row1        | Text        | Text          |
| row2        | Text        | Text          | -->



<!-- ### Code Block
```
# This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
``` -->


<!-- ### Formula
Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:
$$
\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}
$$
or you can write in-text formula $$y = wx + b$$.
