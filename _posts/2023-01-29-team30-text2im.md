> Creating images like illustrations, paintings, and photographs can be time-consuming and require specialized skills. A tool that can generate realistic images from natural language can make it much easier for people to create a wide range of visual content. Additionally, being able to edit images using natural language makes it possible to make precise changes quickly, which is essential in practical applications. This post is a review of different techniques that relate to image generation from text inputs.
