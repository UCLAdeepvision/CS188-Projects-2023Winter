## Skin Cancer Detection
For my project, I have chosen to focus on skin cancer detection, with a focus on Melanoma.

### Three Relevant Papers
- 'Identifying Melanoma Images using EfficientNet Ensemble: Winning Solution to the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge' [Code](https://github.com/haqishen/SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification-1st-Place-Solution) [Paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/identifying-melanoma-images-using) [1]
- 'Melanoma Detection using Adversarial Training and Deep Transfer Learning' [Code](https://github.com/hasibzunair/adversarial-lesions) [Paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/melanoma-detection-using-adversarial-training-1) [2]
- 'Complementary Network with Adaptive Receptive Fields for Melanoma Segmentation' [Code](https://github.com/Guo-Xiaoqing/Skin-Seg) [Paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/complementary-network-with-adaptive-receptive) [3]
